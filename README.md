# discordjs-suggest-command
A shitty suggest command I wrote in about 2 minutes. Easy to setup


# Setup
### So, first. You're going to need a bot. If you don't you can use [my sparkbot](https://github.com/25sp/sparkbot) to either use as your own bot or just test.
Go to the index file. There are multiple formats depending on how your bot works.
Just copy and paste whichever format looks closest to your bot. (If you're using sparkbot use the first one)

# Final
I don't care if you give credits or not, anyone could of written this and it's very basic.
This is easy to abuse. If your running a small bot (25 servers or less) then this is ok. 
I might add embeds to prevent @everyone pings and shit later on
